This file, README_EFSOI_scripts, describes the files in GSI-utils/src/EFSOI_Utilities/scripts
under the branch EFSOI.  They are used for working with data from EFSOI in GDAS/global-workflow 


reduce_osense.py:  Takes the osense data files and reduces them to about 10% the size for 
easier handling, saving as python pickle files. 
Usage: reduce_osense.py  firstcycle lastcycle indir outdir exp 
firstcycle, lastcycle: cycles of first and last expected osense files, format YYYY-MM-DD-HH
indir: location of osense files
outdir: where pickle files will be saved 
exp: experiment name

quickstats.py: Takes output from reduce_osense.py and makes per-cycle stats for plotting.
Usage: quickstats.py  firstcycle lastcycle indir outdir 
firstcycle, lastcycle: cycles of first and last expected osense files, format YYYY-MM-DD-HH
indir: location of output from reduce_osense.py
outdir: where pickle files with statistics will be saved 

allstats.py: Takes output from quickstats.py and makes all-experiment obs impact stats
Usage: allstats.py firstcycle lastcycle indir
firstcycle, lastcycle: cycles of first and last expected osense files, format YYYY-MM-DD-HH
indir: location of output from quickstats.py, also output directory

quickstats.py: Takes output from allstats.py and makes all-experiment obs impact plots
Usage: quickstats.py indir outdir 
indir: location of output from allstats.py
outdir: location of saved plots

convdata_codes.csv: codes needed to organize convetional data sources, derived from
webpage (with the help of tools in pandas): 
https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/prepbufr.doc/table_2.htm 
May need to be periodically updated

copyefsoifiles.sh: copies files from experiment to EFSOI staging directory after 
gdasepos has run 

display_osense.py: reads and plots sensitivity data for single cycle after reading
from osense file generated by EFSOI executable

getefsiofiles.sh: obtains files necessary for gdaseupd task in global workflow,
the modified version of which is the first step in the EFSOI process

osense.py: contains routine to read osense file and others

geoplot.py
osense2nc.py: converts osense files to netcdf files
